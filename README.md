# **DeepLandforms**

Author: giacomo.nodjoumi@hyranet.info - g.nodjoumi@jacobs-university.de

Thise repository contains all the code to build and run *DeepLandforms* a novel toolset that provides all the necessary tools to train an instance segmentation model for landforms detections. Tools includes, data preparation, labeling, training, monitoring and inference.

## Components
### ImageProcessingUtils
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/287286230.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/287286230)

ImageProcessingUtils is a Jupyter Notebook for processing georeferenced images such as GeoTiff, JP2, png/jpeg+world file, CUB (USGS ISIS).
With this tool is possible to perform single to multiple tasks including:

* convert to GeoTiff, Cloud Optimize GeoTiff (COG), JP2, png/jpeg+world file, CUB (USGS ISIS)
* rescale images pixel resolution
* create tiles for images larger than user-defined size limit
* remove black borders for images/tiles
* crop images/tiles with a 1:1 centered aspect ration

The notebook is served through a docker image containing all required packages.
see [official repository](https://github.com/Hyradus/ImageProcessingUtils)

### Labelme
Dockerized version of [wkentaro/labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme)

### DeepLandforms
Main Notebooks to perform training and inference on geo-referenced data.

**DeepLandforms-Training Notebook**

With this notebook, users can train instance segmentation models on custom dataset of georeferenced images.
The models are based on state-of-the-art general purpose architectures, available [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).
Despite several types of networks are supported, such as object detection, image segmentation ad instance segmentation, and available in the above repository, this notebook and the complementary **DeepLandrorms-Segmentation** notebook are specific for instance segmentation architectures for georefernced images.

**DeepLandforms Segmentation Notebook**

With this notebook, users can use custom trained models for instance segmentation models on custom dataset of georeferenced images.
The output consist of a folder containing:
* Source Images in which at least one detection occurred
* Label file in COCO json format for each image
* Geopackage containing a single layer with image name, confidence leve, class.

### Tensorboard

Dockerized version of the popular framework for visualizing training metrics.
See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)


## Requirements

* 25 GB of free disk space
* Ubuntu OS or other distro
* Docker
* Nvidia-docker
* Nvidia GPU
* 16GB RAM (more is better, especially when processing very high-resolution images)
* 8+ cpu cores

## Tutorial

See the tutorial folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Labelme 


#### Labelme not starting due to missing display
The solution is to run the following command:
```
xhost +local:docker 
```
and then again build the container:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

## To-DO

* [ ] Remove nvidia-docker strict requirement
* [ ] Remove Detectron2 and make it optional
* [ ] Implement additional architectures (e.g. U-Net, YOLO)

## Funding
*This study is within the Europlanet 2024 RI and EXPLORE project, and it has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 871149 and No 101004214.*
